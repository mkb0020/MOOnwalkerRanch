# 🐄🛸 MOOnwalker Ranch 🌙

**MOOnwalker Ranch** is a cozy, chaotic, zero-stakes browser game where you pilot a UAP and abduct cows for absolutely no reason at all.

There’s no timer.  
There’s no way to win.
There’s no way to lose.
There is only *vibes*, *beams*, and *mysteriously vanishing livestock*.

> No cows were harmed in the making of this game.

## 👽 Final Notes

MOOnwalker Ranch is meant to be silly, satisfying, and a little absurd.  
If it made you smile even once, mission accomplished.

Happy abducting ✨🐄🛸
